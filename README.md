# Pathfinding-Visualizer

A simple tool which visualizes pathfinding algorithms. Supports **A***, **Djisktras**, and **Greedy best first search**. 

This tool also has the option to use **perlin noise** generation and **recursive backtracking maze** generation to auto-create a map for pathfinding. Of course, you can build and place down walls to simulate as much to your liking!

I made sure to include many customizable options within the tool to experiment with when it comes to the pathfinding algorithms specifically. Such as picking which heuristic type to use when visualizing A* or Greedy best first search.
